tl/dr: use your common sense.
This is an open source project, you can modify anything and re-distribute it anywhere you want.
You can add your own features and claim the modified version afterward whatsoever.
No credits to the original creators required, but it would be nice if you did. I'm not petty enough to care about that.
Don't re-sell it "as is" to others, just because you found the link.

Good luck, have fun! Stay safe.
